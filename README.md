How to Run the Application Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine:

Step 1: Install Python

Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure to check the option "Add Python to PATH" during installation so you can run Python commands from the terminal.

Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
Open your terminal or VS Code terminal and run the following commands to install Flask and the Genius API dependency:

```pip install flask```
```pip install lyricsgenius```

Step 3: Run the Application
Navigate to the folder where your application code is located and run the main Python file (e.g., app.py) with:

python app.py
After running the command, the terminal will show a localhost URL (usually something like ```http://127.0.0.1:5000).``` Open this URL in your web browser to access and test the application locally.
